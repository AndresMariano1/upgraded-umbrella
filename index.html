        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science/Administrative StudiesðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>I am an undergraduate freshman at the University of California, Riverside. I am pursuing a dual degree in political science and business administration studies. I am currently located in Fontana, California. After completing my undergraduate studies, I want to attend a law school and pursue a J.D degree. I have a strong interest in the fields of business and politics and hope to apply that knowledge to my future legal career. I am involved in some organizations at my university, such as mock trial and Lawtinx, a Latino organization that is directed towards potential law students. I hope to join more organizations and network with more people once we return to campus. I joined the mock trial team to help me develop my debating skills and get to know other students interested in having a career in law. I joined Lawtinx to get to know others who want to become lawyers and provide me with resources. <br>

        Some activities that interest me include fitness, reading, and occasionally playing video games. I have learned skills in the classroom, workplace, and participating in teams. I have a 3.69 GPA and always complete my schoolwork on time and with academic excellence. I always hold myself to high standards no matter the environment. I have worked at different jobs and always try to do more than the minimum. When I worked at Mcdonaldâ€™s, I always ensured that the customers got their orders quickly and satisfactorily. I also made sure that I was doing something productive and not wasting any time. At my first job at a Christmas set at South Coast Plaza, located in Costa Mesa, California, I was versatile. I was a photographer, cashier, and guest welcomer. I learned how to interact with different people professionally, and I handled money as a cashier. During my work experience, I also learned to effectively work with other people to give the customers the best experience. <br><br>

        Looking forward to my future education and career, I hope to gain even more knowledge and work experience. I will work diligently to network with different people at my school and at any opportunity, such as at work or internships. Whichever company I work for in the future, I will bring the skills that I have learned and work laboriously and professionally to ensure that the company succeeds and that I get my job done. I am open to any new experiences and do not hesitate to start a new project from scratch. I will politely work with any team and take charge to complete our tasks. I enjoy working with and meeting new people and make sure that everyone on my team is working hard and is on the right track. As I further my education at the University of California, Riverside, I will only become a more valuable asset for a company to use and prosper from. I believe that one of the most important parts of success is consistent hard work that is aimed towards a goal.
